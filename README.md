# Chapter 3 - Evaluation Metrics

This project contains my hands-on implementation of binary classification evaluation techniques from **Chapter 3** of the book:
*Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* 
by Aurelien Geron (3rd Edition)

## Techniques Covered
- Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
- Decision Threshold Tuning
- Precision/Recall Curve
- ROC Curve and AUC Score
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

> Run in JupyterLab using a mini MNIST dataset.

My AUC Score: **0.9978**
